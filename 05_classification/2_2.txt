After implementing a function to calculate the accuracy of each method, I get these results:
Accuracy maximum likelihood : 96.61016949152543 %
Accuracy maximum aposteriori: 96.61016949152543 %

These accuracies are identical. As the samples given are random, the values change each run.

After implementing the confusion matrice function, here are the results:
likelihood method :
[[17  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0 15  1 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0  1 25 ...  0  0  0]
 ...
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]]

aposteriori method:
[[17  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0 15  1 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0  1 25 ...  0  0  0]
 ...
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]
 [ 0  0  0 ...  0  0  0]]

The prediction from each method result on the same accuracy. 
From the different runs, we can see that the maximum likelihood (method 1) and the maximum 
a posteriori (method 2) values are not similar.

method 1:
[[8.98 e-003 2.62 e-034 1.09 e-071]
 [5.61 e+000 3.37 e-028 3.45 e-056]
method 2:
[[3.19 e-003 9.90 e-035 2.91 e-072]
 [1.99 e+000 1.27 e-028 9.22 e-057]

The differences between the values of the different classes in method 2 are more important than in the method 1,
making it a better classifier. However, the prediction deduced from these values are the same. That is why
we end up with the same accuracy.
