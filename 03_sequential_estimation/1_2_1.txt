The batch estimate is not exactly [0, 1, -1] because the mean of the normal 
distribution is this value. Furthermore, the variance of 1.73 so it is a quite large curve.
You can act upon the variance of the normal distribution or the number of samples 'n' to reduce the error.
Reducing the value of the variance will reduce the width of the curve.
Increasing the number of samples will also make the estimate more accurate.
