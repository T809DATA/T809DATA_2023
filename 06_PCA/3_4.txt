Eigenvalue plot:

In this plot, every point represent the amount of variance explained by each compenent of our dataset.
It has a rapide drop after the first component (principal component) because the first few components 
capture the most important patterns and variance in the data. The rest of the components capture 
the  minor variations and the noise.

log eigenvalue plot:

When the data is plot logarithmically, we can easily see how small get the values near to 0 in the 
previous one. The values are decreasing almost lineary in this log plot. In reality it decreases 
exponentially.

cumulative variance plot:

This plot shows the cumulative proportion of variance through all the components from 0% to 100%. 
We can see that for the index number 0 (X=1) already 98% of the variance is reached. With the 
index 1 and 2 100% is almost reached. Those 3 first dimensions can then be considered as determinant 
for our dataset in term of variance inside the dataset.
