The dimensions that correllate the best with the first dimension are those ones:

1,1 - dimension 1: radius_mean

1,3 - dimension 3: perimeter_mean
1,4 - dimension 4: area_mean
4,3 - dimension 21: radius_worst
4,5 - dimension 23: perimeter_worst
4,6 - dimension 24: area_worst

As all the features are in fonction of the radius of the sample, it is obvious that they look similar
In contrary, the other dimensions do not.
